# Recap

* Today's focus is branching and merging, but we will recap as well

* 2 hours available for both theory and practice

* Version control (and git in particular) has a steep learning curve â€“ do ask
  for help getting started

* There are many resources for self learning
  * Software Carpentry
  * Courses within the University of Oxford / Lynda.com
  * The Research Support team in SOGE

---

## What is Git?

* version control system

* keep track of changes

* Other examples:
    * File naming: program_v1.py, program_v2.py
    * Microsoft Word Track changes
    * Other repository systems such as: Subversion (SVN) or Concurrent Version System (CVS)

---

## The git architecture

* The Git 'Three-tree-architecture'

![Three tree architecture](../fig/three-tree-commit.png)

---

## The git workflow

- **commit**

  a small set of changes, which accumulate to make a **history** of commits

--

- **repository**

  a place for a project

--

- **remote** repository

  a place to share a project

--

- **branch**

  a way to separate work on new versions, bug-fixes or features

--

- **merge**

  a way to incorporate changes from one branch into another

## Summary

Starting out

`git init`

`git clone`

<br>

--

Committing

`git add ...`

`git commit -m "..."`

<br>

--

Information

`git status`

`git log`

---

## Summary

Remotes

`git push`

`git pull`

<br>

--

Branches

`git branch ...`

`git merge ...`

`git checkout ...`

--

<br>

**......Questions?**

...then let's get ready

# Practical 1

## Installing Git

Windows: 
* Download and install:
`http://git-scm.com/download/win`

Linux (most debian-based distributions)
* Download and install:
`apt-get install git-all`

Others:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

---

# Practical 1
## Configuring Git

```
git config --global user.name "Roald Lemmen"
git config --global user.email "roald.lemmen@ouce.ox.ac.uk"
git config --global color.ui "auto"
git config --global core.editor notepad` or alternative editor
```

* These settings are stored in stored in $root/.git/.gitconfig
* The email address should be the same as the one configured in your remote repository (such as Github)

---

# Practical 1
## Line endings

Windows and Mac/Linux handle line endings differently, and we want to be able to
share files between operating systems.

Git has a setting that _should_ let us set a sensible default.

On Windows, set it to `true`:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

On Mac or Linux, set it to `input`:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```
---

# Practical 1
## Objectives
* Make sure all computers are setup correctly
* Recap the Git Basics

## Exercise
We are are looking for cool places in Oxford. We would like to ask the community (you!), to help us develop a map of recommendations. This can be anything, from a good bar, restaurant, activity to a museum.

```
Assignment: Add 5 recommendations to the map
```

# Branching and merging

Objectives:
* Gain a understand of Git commit-identifier and HEAD
* Gain a deeper understanding of branching and merging
* Demonstrate branch, merge and merge conflicts

---

## Commit identifiers (Hash) values in Git

Each commit contains
* Metadata
* File changes
* Parent identifier - SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)

<br/>

<img src="../fig/git-commits-and-parents.png" height="70%" width="70%">

---

## HEAD in Git

How does git know what branch you are currently on?
* Git keeps a special pointer called HEAD
* HEAD is a reference to the identifier of the last commit in the currently checked-out branch

<br/>

<img src="../fig/git-head-to-master.png" height="70%" width="70%">

---

## HEAD in Git

* The HEAD moves forward with each commit
* HEAD helps easily switch your work environment to other branches

<br/>

![Branching](../fig/git-branching.png)

---

## Basic branching

Create a new branch

`git branch ...`

<br/>

--

Show branches

`git branch`

--

<br/>

Checkout a branch 

`git checkout ...`

--

<br/>

Make a change, stage the change and commit

`git add ...`

`git commit -m "..."`

--

<br/>

(Optional) Change in-between branches

`git checkout ...`

---

## Basic merging

Check out the receiving branch

`git checkout ...`

<br/>

--

Merge changes into the receiving branch

`git merge ...`

---

## More about merging

Two types of merging:

--

* Fast-forward merge
  * If no commits have been made to receiving branch since branching
  * Append commits on tip of the receiving branch
  * No additional commit will be made

---

# Fast-forward merge

---

# Fast-forward merge

<img src="../fig/git-merge-fastforward-2.svg">

---

## More about merging

* True merge
  * If additional commits were made to the receiving branch
  * and git can solve the merge by an inbuilt strategy
  * Merge commit will be made

---

## More about merging

<img src="../fig/git-merge-true-2.svg" height="444" width="706">

---

## More about merging

* But what if git can't solve the merge?

--

<img src="../fig/merge-conflict.png">

--

* Merge conflicts
  * Branches have conflicting modifications in a file
  * Error message will pop up (CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in ...)
  * Git marks the conflict in file 

---

## Merge conflicts

Three options in case of a merge conflict:

* 1) abort merge to return to stage before merge attempts

`git merge --abort`

--

* 2) solve merge manually (edit temporary file, remove flags and save)

`git add <file>`

`git commit -m "Merged branch manually"`

--

* 3) use merge tool

`git mergetool --tool`

---

## Merge conflicts

* Git will mark the file
```
print('Hello, dog!')
<<<<<<< HEAD
print('Hello, cat!')
=======
>>>>>>> master
```
--

* Which can just be resolved using a standard text editor

--

* Or a more advanced one with support for this, such as Visual Studio Code:

<img src="../fig/merge-conflict-vscode.png">

---

# Practical 2

## Objectives:
* Understand the Git workflow
* Practice checkout, commit, branching and merging
* Learn how to resolve merge conflicts
* Learn how to contribute to a Git project

## Exercise
```
Assignment: We would like to ask your help, to rate the contents on the map.
Change the rating to whatever you like, and merge this into the master branch.
```
